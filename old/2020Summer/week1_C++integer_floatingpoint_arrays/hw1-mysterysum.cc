//HW1: Mystery Sum
// Compute the following sum: using float (so you can see the error)


// 1/(1*1) + 1/(2*2) + ... + 1/(n*n)
// s= 1/1 + 0.25 + .111111... + 1/16 + .04 + ...
// go until you get no more accuracy

//print out sqrt(s*6)

// do this forwards and backwards.  You will find one way is more accurate
// which way is more accurate??
